Working on the Front-End
========================

## Overview.

Go will serves static assets in `web/dist/*`. All files inside that directory
are generated by `grunt`.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you've [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
* Install required packages in this directory:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

* Install [bower](http://bower.io/):

  ```
  npm install -g bower
  ```

* Install packages from bower:

  ```
  bower install
  ```

* Install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

  ```
  npm install -g grunt-cli
  ```

* Run `grunt` to build `dist` files:

  ```
  grunt
  ```

  You should get output like following:

  ```
  Running "clean:0" (clean) task
  Cleaning dist/...OK

  Running "jshint:0" (jshint) task
  >> 1 file lint free.

  Running "uglify:dist" (uglify) task
  File assets/js/all.min.js created: 206.13 kB â†’ 159.99 kB

  Running "cssmin:dist" (cssmin) task
  File assets/css/all.min.css created.

  Running "processhtml:dist" (processhtml) task

  Running "copy:dist" (copy) task
  Created 1 directories

  Done, without errors.
  ```

* You can use `grunt watch` while developing. This will watches changes in `assets/js/*`,
  `assets/css/*`, `assets/img/*`, and HTML files.
