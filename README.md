# Go Challenge App

Go Challenge is off to a great start, and to make it even more 
awesome - we should build a great app to run the challenge.

While the current process of emailing zips worked well, it requires
some manual orchestration, and might not scale that well. After some
discussion on [golang-challenge Slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/golang-challenge/),
this project was born as a community effort to improve this process.

The basic idea is to take some inspiration from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) project,
and build a similar command line driven workflow for Go challenge. Of course, given a more
restrictive nature of the challenge itself (compared to exercism.io's free-flow exercises),
we'll have to modify bits and piece to make it fit the rules of the challenge.
